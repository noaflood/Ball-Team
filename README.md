# Ball-Team
 Organize data about a baseball team.
 
 This was the last project (Project 11) for my Java 1 course at university. It incorporates concepts of encapsulation, scope, polymorphism, exceptions, interfaces, inheritance, and others.
 
 To run, download all the source files and run main with a command-line argument of the path/filename of the data file you want to use.
